# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard


## Description
The motivation for this project was to create a  weather dashboard to incorporate the new elements of JavaScript and Server-Side APIs that I have learned. I incorporated loops, Event Listeners, Local Storage interaction, and a weather based API to accomplish this. I heavily expanded on my JavaScript funtionality and knowledge of APIs and am very happy with the result.
